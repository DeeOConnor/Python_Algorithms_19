## Pre-requisites:
Install Python at the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install pip following the instructions at the following link: https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/
<br/>

<br/>
On the command line with pip:<br/>

## Creating a student account on GitHub is free and will allow you access to private repositories as well as other features.
<br/>
To get access to the repository here, run the following command:
<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/DeeOConnor/Python_Algorithms_19.git`
<br/>
You may be required to authenticate with your GitHub credentials. This creates a local version of the code repo that exists only on your machine. You can edit and add to the code and files there, and when you want to push your changes to this code base, we will cover the steps needed in class.
